		<h3><u>Our story</u></h3>
		<p><b><i>
We have always been obsessed with pre-empting and fulfilling the wants of today’s diner. In 2022, it simply meant allowing diners to reserve a guaranteed table at the top restaurants in the city. In 2022, we has evolved to providing multiple benefits on one platform for all dining out needs.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Connecting diners to the best-in-the-city restaurant discounts & deals</li><br>
	<li>Giving diners a cashless payment experience across restaurants & an opportunity to earn cashback on every payment</li><br>
	<li>A unique membership - The Table Passport - with massive benefits for the real connoisseur of food.</li><br>
</ul>
The Table was founded by Shreeram & Sumanth in 2022 and was acquired by Times Internet Limited in 2022. Times Internet is India’s largest digital products company and the digital venture of Times of India, India's largest media and entertainment group.</i></b></p>
